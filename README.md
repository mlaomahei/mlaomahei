# Hey, I'm Mosiah 👋

**Aspiring Full-Stack Developer from Auckland, New Zealand**

I'm a 19-year-old developer learning modern web technologies through hands-on projects and structured mentorship. Currently exploring what to build next.

---

## What I'm Working With

**Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

**Other:** Roblox Studio (Lua), Git, Vercel

---

## Previous Projects

- **[E7Baron](E7Baron.netlify.app)** — A database and resource hub for the mobile game Epic Seven, built with Next.js and React
- **[Sesa](https://github.com/mlaomahei/sesa)** — A Secret Santa Discord bot

---

## What I'm Exploring

I'm figuring out what project to commit to next. Current directions I'm considering:

- **Roblox game development** — building games on the platform with monetisation in mind
- **RobloxThreads** — a fan site concept combining avatar customisation with in-game integration
- **Guild management tools** — accountability and coordination tools for gaming communities

I like projects that solve real problems for communities I'm already part of.

## About Me

I learn by building. I'm currently in a mentorship program with a senior full-stack developer, working through daily calls and practical projects. I pick up patterns quickly and enjoy figuring out how things fit together.

I also co-lead a gaming guild where I handle strategy, member coordination, and performance tracking — organising people is its own kind of problem-solving.
