## About Me

I learn by building. I'm currently in a mentorship program with a senior full-stack developer, working through daily calls and practical projects. I pick up patterns quickly and enjoy figuring out how things fit together.

I also co-lead a gaming guild where I handle strategy, member coordination, and performance tracking — organising people is its own kind of problem-solving.
